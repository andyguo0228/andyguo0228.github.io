<p>Hi, my name is Andy Guo. I’m a self-taught data analyst and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center.</p>

<p>Data has always fascinated me, both as a language and as a window into understanding complex systems. For most of my career, I’ve been deeply involved in healthcare, a field which taught me the importance of precision, attention to detail, and the value of using evidence to make decisions. While I thrived in healthcare, I was always drawn to the underlying data that drove decisions. This curiosity eventually led me on a self-learning journey, where I used a mix of online courses, tutorials, and a whole lot of trial and error to teach myself data science. The experience challenged me in ways I would have never anticipated, but it also pushed me to discover what I’m capable of. All the late nights combing through documentation, every coding syntax I learned, and each dataset I explored, allowed me to build a strong foundation with essential data tools such as SQL, Python, and Tableau. So here I am, a self-taught data analyst with a unique blend of healthcare knowledge and analytical expertise, eager to make a positive impact with his newfound skills.</p>

<p>Some fun facts about me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Passionate about the environment and sustainability 🌎</li>
  <li>I can’t stop listening to NewJeans 👖</li>
  <li>Big fan of Sumo Citrus and waiting for them to be in season again 🍊</li>
  <li>I destress by playing Jazz piano 🎹</li>
  <li>I will never say no to Korean BBQ 🥩 or bubble tea 🧋</li>
  <li>My spirit animal and favorite Python library is Pandas 🐼</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit by my portfolio. Please feel free to explore my projects to have a better idea of how I approach and solve problems. I’d love to connect and discuss any questions you may have about my work so please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>

and ever since I wrote my first SQL query, I've been captivated  everything related to data and coding.
