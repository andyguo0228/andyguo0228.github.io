<p>Hi, my name is Andy Guo. Iâ€™m a self-taught data analyst and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center.</p>

<p>In February 2022, I made a life-changing decisionâ€”I started learning about data science. It was a daunting experience at first because I have never coded anything before in my life. But I kept at it and the more I learned, the more my curiosity grew. I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate course along with several other online courses to improve my proficiency with many data related tools and concepts. 
Iâ€™ve been facinated with data ever since I wrote my first SQL query and if I wasnâ€™t working at my day job, I was working on my data projects.</p>

<p>Below are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio and for taking an interest in my passion ðŸ˜Š</p>

<!--
and ever since I wrote my first SQL query, I've been captivated  everything related to data and coding. Nothing gets me more excited than a messy dataset, just waiting for someone to uncover it's hidden insights. Much like cleaning at home, I find cleaning data to be very therapeutic and satisfying.
