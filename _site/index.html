<p>Hi, my name is Andy Guo. I’m a self-taught data analyst and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center.</p>

<p>In February 2022, I made a life-changing decision—I started learning about data science. It was a daunting experience at first because I’ve never coded anything before in my life. But I kept at it and the more I learned, the more my curiosity grew. I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate course and dove headfirst into several other online courses to expand my data toolkit. Throughout this self-guided learning adventure, I discovered a genuine passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights and as my skills grew, so did my desire to apply them in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Below are some of my skills and projects that I’ve worked on.</p>

<h2 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Proficiency in analyzing large datasets using various statistical methods and techniques to derive insights and support decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL</strong>: Strong command of SQL for data manipulation, extraction, and database management tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Programming Languages</strong>: Experience in languages such as Python and R for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and automation of data processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Skill in creating visually appealing and informative data visualizations using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or matplotlib in Python.</li>
  <li><strong>Excel</strong>: Proficiency in utilizing Excel for data cleaning, data transformation, formula-based calculations, and generating reports and dashboards.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</strong>: Ability to clean and preprocess data, including handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong>: Familiarity with statistical concepts, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and other statistical techniques to extract insights from data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="soft-skills">Soft Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Critical Thinking</strong>: Capacity to evaluate information objectively, consider alternative solutions, and make informed decisions based on evidence.</li>
  <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong>: Aptitude for identifying and resolving complex data-related issues by applying analytical techniques and creative thinking.</li>
  <li><strong>Attention to Detail</strong>: Strong focus on accuracy and precision when working with data, ensuring that analyses and reports are error-free.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Ability to work well in a team environment, collaborating with colleagues from diverse backgrounds and contributing to shared goals.</li>
  <li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Flexibility to adjust and thrive in a dynamic and fast-paced work environment, embracing new technologies and approaches.</li>
</ul>

<!--
and ever since I wrote my first SQL query, I've been captivated  everything related to data and coding. Nothing gets me more excited than a messy dataset, just waiting for someone to uncover it's hidden insights. Much like cleaning at home, I find cleaning data to be very therapeutic and satisfying.
