About Me üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
--------
Hi, I'm Andy Guo and this is my portfolio. I'm a self-taught data professional and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center. 

Data has always fascinated me, both as a language and as a window into understanding complex systems. For most of my career, I've been deeply involved in healthcare, a field which taught me the importance of precision, attention to detail, and the value of using evidence to make decisions. While I thrived in healthcare, I was always drawn to the underlying data that drove decisions. This curiosity eventually led me on a self-learning journey, where I used a mix of online courses, tutorials, and a whole lot of trial and error to teach myself data science. The experience challenged me in ways I would have never anticipated, but it also pushed me to discover what I'm capable of. All the late nights combing through documentation, every coding syntax I learned, and each dataset I explored, allowed me to build a strong foundation with essential data tools such as SQL, Python, and Tableau. So here I am, a self-taught data analyst with a unique blend of healthcare knowledge and analytical expertise, eager to make a positive impact with his newfound skills.




For most of my career, I've been working in healthcare and while I found it meaningful, I was always drawn to the underlying data that drove decisions. I was fascinated by the idea of transforming complex data into something easy to digest and actionable which could improve patient care and quality of life. This eventually led me to start my jouney to teach myself data science using online courses and videos. The experience was challenging to say the least. I had no computer science experience and had never written a single line of code before. I was confused and had no idea what I was doing, and I loved every minute of it. 




and work on personal projects to hone my skills in SQL, Python, and Tableau. 




Although my path has been unconventional, I know it's the right one.




Hello there, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm [Your Name], a data enthusiast and puzzle-solver at heart, and I thrive in digging into complex datasets to unveil compelling stories and insights that drive decision making.

My background is an interesting blend of healthcare and data analytics. While working in the healthcare sector, I quickly discovered my innate affinity for numbers and patterns. This led me on a journey of self-education, propelled by sheer curiosity and the compelling power of online resources, to teach myself data science. From data mining, machine learning algorithms to data visualization, I've spent countless hours on my keyboard in a quest to decrypt the language of data.

And you know what? I realized that data is not just about numbers and algorithms. It's about translating complex, confusing information into something digestible, relatable, and actionable. It's about bridging gaps and facilitating change. This sparked a passion in me to use data for the greater good, to streamline processes, and to make life a little bit easier.

Over time, I've worked on a wide array of fascinating projects that helped hone my skills in SQL, Python, and R programming, Tableau, and other analytics tools. Each project was like a new mystery waiting to be unraveled, and the more I delved into these, the more I became passionate about my newfound career.

Now, I'm seeking new adventures in the realm of data analytics. While I'm grateful for my healthcare experience - it truly honed my empathy and problem-solving skills - I'm excited to transfer these valuable attributes into the data analytics field. I'm ready for a new challenge, eager to explore different industries, and can't wait to transform raw data into meaningful, actionable insights.

I believe my unique blend of experiences and self-taught knowledge provides me with a different perspective on data. So, whether you're looking for someone to dive into a sea of unorganized data or need a passionate analyst who won't rest until the last piece of the puzzle is in place, I'm your guy!

Feel free to explore my portfolio, where I've shared some of the projects I'm most proud of. And don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to chat about data, collaborate on a project, or even if you simply need a good book recommendation!

Thank you for stopping by. Let's discover what stories your data has to tell!

and ever since I wrote my first SQL query, I've been captivated  everything related to data and coding. Nothing gets me more excited than a messy dataset, just waiting for someone to uncover it's hidden insights. Much like cleaning at home, I find cleaning data to be very therapeutic and satisfying.
