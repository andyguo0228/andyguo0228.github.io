About Me 🙋🏻‍♂️
--------
Hi, I'm Andy Guo and this is my portfolio. I'm a self-taught data professional and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center.

For most of my career, I've been working in healthcare and while I found it meaningful, I was always drawn to the underlying data that drove decisions. I was fascinated by the idea of transforming complex data into something easy to digest and actionable which could improve patient care and quality of life. This eventually led me to start my journey to teach myself data science using online courses and videos. It was challenging to say the least as I had no computer science background and had never written a single line of code before. I struggled, I persevered, and now I have a portfolio demonstrating my skills and passion for data science. 

I’m excited to present the projects that I’ve worked on. Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or to discuss any questions you may have about my work. Thanks for visiting! 😊
