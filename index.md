Hi there! I'm Andy Guo 😜

I'm a self-taught data analyst and a medical scribe at a cancer center in New York. 

For most of my career, I've been working in healthcare and while I found it meaningful, I was always drawn to the underlying data that drove decisions. I was fascinated by the idea of transforming complex data into something easy to digest and actionable which could improve patient care and quality of life. This led me to start my journey to teach myself data analytics using online resources, cultivating a skill set that I am eager to showcase.
