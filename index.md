About Me 🙋🏻‍♂️
--------
Hi, my name is Andy Guo. I'm a self-taught data analyst and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center. 

Data has always fascinated me, both as a language and as a window into understanding complex systems. For most of my career, I've been deeply involved in healthcare, a field which taught me the importance of precision, attention to detail, and the value of using evidence to make decisions. While I thrived in healthcare, I was always drawn to the underlying data that drove decisions. This curiosity eventually led me on a self-learning journey, where I used a mix of online courses, tutorials, and a whole lot of trial and error to teach myself data science. The experience challenged me in ways I would have never anticipated, but it also pushed me to discover what I'm capable of. All the late nights combing through documentation, every coding syntax I learned, and each dataset I explored, allowed me to build a strong foundation with essential data tools such as SQL, Python, and Tableau. So here I am, a self-taught data analyst with a unique blend of healthcare knowledge and analytical expertise, eager to make a positive impact with his newfound skills.

Some fun facts about me:
- Passionate about the environment and sustainability 🌎
- I can't stop listening to NewJeans 👖
- Big fan of Sumo Citrus and waiting for them to be in season again 🍊
- I destress by playing Jazz piano 🎹
- I will never say no to Korean BBQ 🥩 or bubble tea 🧋
- My spirit animal and favorite Python library is Pandas 🐼

Thank you for taking the time to visit by my portfolio. Please feel free to explore my projects to have a better idea of how I approach and solve problems. I'd love to connect and discuss any questions you may have about my work so please don't hesitate to reach out.

and ever since I wrote my first SQL query, I've been captivated  everything related to data and coding. Nothing gets me more excited than a messy dataset, just waiting for someone to uncover it's hidden insights. Much like cleaning at home, I find cleaning data to be very therapeutic and satisfying.
