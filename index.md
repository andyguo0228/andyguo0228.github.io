About Me
--------
Hi, my name is Andy Guo. I'm a self-taught data analyst and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center. 

In February 2022, I made a life-changing decisionâ€”I started learning about data science. It was a daunting experience at first because I have never coded anything before in my life. But I kept at it and the more I learned, the more my curiosity grew. I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate course along with several other online courses to improve my proficiency with many data related tools and concepts. 
I've been facinated with data ever since I wrote my first SQL query and if I wasn't working at my day job, I was working on my data projects.  

Below are some of the projects I've worked on. 

Thank you for visiting my portfolio and for taking an interest in my passion ðŸ˜Š

and ever since I wrote my first SQL query, I've been captivated  everything related to data and coding. Nothing gets me more excited than a messy dataset, just waiting for someone to uncover it's hidden insights. Much like cleaning at home, I find cleaning data to be very therapeutic and satisfying.
