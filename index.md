About Me
--------
Hi, my name is Andy Guo. I'm a self-taught data analyst and currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center. 

In February 2022 I decided it was time for a change and started learning about data science. Since writing my first SQL query, I've been fascinated with anything related to data or coding.
