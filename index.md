Hi there, my name is {{site.author}} and I'm a self-taught data analyst. I have a strong background managing healthcare data as a medical scribe working in oncology and I'm very passionate about data science. I enjoy the technical aspect of preparing and cleaning data as well as the creative side of telling stories through visualizations. In my free time, I enjoy going to the library to work on my projects and eating Korean BBQ. I'm also a big fan of NewJeans 👖 and Sumo Citrus 🍊.
