About Me 🙋🏻‍♂️
--------
Hi, I'm Andy Guo and this is my portfolio. I'm a self-taught data professional and I currently work as a medical scribe at a cancer center.

For most of my career, I've been working in healthcare and while I found it meaningful, I was always drawn to the underlying data that drove decisions. I was fascinated by the idea of transforming complex data into something easy to digest and actionable which could improve patient care and quality of life. This eventually led me to start my jouney to teach myself data science using online courses and videos. The experience was challenging to say the least. I had no computer science experience and had never written a single line of code before. It was a struggle and most of the time I had no idea what I was doing, but I loved every minute of it. I literally started from the bottom and now I'm here with examples of my work in this portfolio demonstrating my capabilities and enthusiasm for data science. 

Some fun facts about me:
- Passionate about the environment and sustainability 🌎
- I can't stop listening to NewJeans 👖
- Big fan of Sumo Citrus and waiting for them to be in season again 🍊
- I destress by playing Jazz piano 🎹
- I will never say no to Korean BBQ 🥩 or bubble tea 🧋
- My spirit animal and favorite Python library is Pandas 🐼

Thank you for taking the time to visit by my portfolio. Please feel free to explore my projects to have a better idea of how I approach and solve problems. I'd love to connect and discuss any questions you may have about my work so please don't hesitate to reach out.
